# FROGGER
Adv. Programming Final Project

This is my simple version of classic game **FROGGER**. The goal is to get the frog home through a few obstacles.
Implements the graphics.py library, as a requirement.

### IMPORTANT NOTE: It is not yet finished. Will create the game using Turtle graphics instead.
