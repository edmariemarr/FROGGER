# FROGGER
Adv. Programming Final Project

This is my simple version of classic game FROGGER. The goal is to get the frog home through a few obstacles.
Implements the graphics.py library.

**MAIN GOALS:**
- [x] Create frog and cars with images
- [x] Move frog with WASD keys
- [x] Car movement
- [] Make sure cars loop on window, creating traffic </br>
- [] Car and frog collision causes life loss and frog moves to square one
- *Must work on*: Collision works but reset doesn't work properly
- [] Loss of 3 lives is GAME OVER
- [] Show GAME OVER text
- [] Getting home means player wins
- *Must work on*: Doesn't show text output
