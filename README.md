# FROGGER
Adv. Programming Final Project

This is my simple version of classic game FROGGER. The goal is to get the frog home through a few obstacles.
Implements the graphics.py library.

**MAIN GOALS:**
- [x] Create frog and cars with images
- [x] Move frog with WASD keys
- [x] Car movement </br>
[] Make sure cars loop on window, creating traffic </br>
- [x] Car and frog collision causes life loss and frog moves to square one </br>
- [x] Create images for the frog's 3 lives
- [x] Loss of 3 lives is GAME OVER </br>
- [x] Show GAME OVER text </br>
- [x] Add lilypads to serve as frog's home </br>
- [x] Getting home means player wins </br>

Current errors present: Collision happens preemptively so winning or losing text appears at beginning and loss of lives occurs, movement difficulty, no traffic.
