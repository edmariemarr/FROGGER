# FROGGER
Adv. Programming Final Project

This is my simple version of classic game FROGGER. The goal is to get the frog home through a few obstacles.
Implements the graphics.py library, as a requirement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is not yet finished.

Current errors present: Collision happens preemptively so winning or losing text appears at beginning and loss of lives occurs, movement difficulty, reset to square one doesn't delete past character's steps, no traffic.
